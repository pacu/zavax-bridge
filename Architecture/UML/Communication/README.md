## Communication Diagrams
These communication diagrams are helpful if you would like to zoom in on parts of the sequence diagrams with a focus on component interactions. Use the [sequence](../Sequence/) diagrams for an overview of the process, and then use the communication diagrams to view communication between components in a different layout.

Notes:
- Numbers correspond to the numbers in the associated sequence diagram.
- The first action in each communication diagram is shown in **bold**.
- Where arrows and words overlap, different colors have been added for clarity.
